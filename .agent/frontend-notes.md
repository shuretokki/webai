Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures how quickly the main content of a page becomes visible. A good LCP is crucial for user perception and search ranking. Techniques to improve it include server-rendering HTML, reducing render-blocking JavaScript, optimizing images, and deferring non-essential resources.

Interaction to Next Paint (INP): Measures a page's overall responsiveness to user interactions throughout the session. It replaced the older First Input Delay because modern web architectures mean interactivity can vary, not just for the first click.

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures how much visible content shifts around as the page loads (4:39). This often happens due to images without defined dimensions, dynamic content injection, or late-loading fonts. Fixing CLS involves reserving space for elements and preloading fonts.
